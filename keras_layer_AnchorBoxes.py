class AnchorBoxes(Layer):
    '''
    Create an output tensor containing anchor boxes based on the input tensor and
    the passed arguments.

    A set of 2D anchor boxes of different aspect ratios is created for each spatial unit of
    the input tensor. The number of anchor boxes created per unit depends on the arguments
    `aspect_ratios` and `two_boxes_for_ar1`, in the default case it is 4. The boxes
    are parameterized by `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`.

    The logic implemented by this layer is identical to the logic in the module
    `ssd_box_encode_decode_utils.py`.

    The purpose of having this layer in the network is to make the model self-sufficient
    at inference time. Since the model is predicting offsets to the anchor boxes
    (rather than predicting box coordinates directly), one needs to know the anchor
    boxes in order to construct the prediction boxes from the offsets. If the model
    didn't contain this layer, one would always need to be able to generate the appropriate
    anchor box tensor externally and ad hoc for inference, which would be impossible for
    someone who only has the model itself. The reason why it is necessary to predict offsets
    to the anchor boxes rather than to predict box coordinates directly will be explained
    elsewhere.

    Input shape:
        4D tensor of shape `(batch, channels, height, width)` if `dim_ordering = 'th'`
        or `(batch, height, width, channels)` if `dim_ordering = 'tf'`.

    Output shape:
        5D tensor of shape `(batch, height, width, n_boxes, 4)`.

        The logic implemented here is identical to the logic in the module `ssd_box_encode_decode_utils.py`.

        Note that this tensor does not participate in any graph computations at runtime. It is being created
        as a constant once for each classification conv layer during graph creation and is just being output
        along with the rest of the model output during runtime. Because of this, all logic is implemented
        as Numpy array operations and it is sufficient to convert the resulting Numpy array into a Keras tensor
        at the very end before outputting it.
