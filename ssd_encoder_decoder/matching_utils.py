def match_bipartite_greedy(weight_matrix):
    '''
    Returns a bipartite matching according to the given weight matrix.

    The algorithm works as follows:

    Let the first axis of `weight_matrix` represent ground truth boxes
    and the second axis anchor boxes.
    The ground truth box that has the greatest similarity with any
    anchor box will be matched first, then out of the remaining ground
    truth boxes, the ground truth box that has the greatest similarity
    with any of the remaining anchor boxes will be matched second, and
    so on. That is, the ground truth boxes will be matched in descending
    order by maximum similarity with any of the respectively remaining
    anchor boxes.
    The runtime complexity is O(m^2 * n), where `m` is the number of
    ground truth boxes and `n` is the number of anchor boxes.

    Arguments:
        weight_matrix (array): A 2D Numpy array that represents the weight matrix
            for the matching process. If `(m,n)` is the shape of the weight matrix,
            it must be `m <= n`. The weights can be integers or floating point
            numbers. The matching process will maximize, i.e. larger weights are
            preferred over smaller weights.

    Returns:
        A 1D Numpy array of length `weight_matrix.shape[0]` that represents
        the matched index along the second axis of `weight_matrix` for each index
        along the first axis.
    '''

    weight_matrix = np.copy(weight_matrix) # We'll modify this array.
    num_ground_truth_boxes = weight_matrix.shape[0]
    all_gt_indices = list(range(num_ground_truth_boxes)) # Only relevant for fancy-indexing below.

    # This 1D array will contain for each ground truth box the index of
    # the matched anchor box.
    matches = np.zeros(ground_truth_boxes.shape[0])

    # In each iteration of the loop below, exactly one ground truth box
    # will be matched to one anchor box.
    for _ in range(num_ground_truth_boxes):

        # Find the maximal anchor-ground truth pair in two steps: First, reduce
        # over the anchor boxes and then reduce over the ground truth boxes.
        anchor_indices = np.argmax(weight_matrix, axis=1) # Reduce along the anchor box axis.
        overlaps = weight_matrix[all_gt_indices, anchor_indices]
        ground_truth_index = np.argmax(overlaps) # Reduce along the ground truth box axis.
        anchor_index = anchor_indices[ground_truth_index]
        matches[ground_truth_index] = anchor_index # Set the match.

        # Set the row of the matched ground truth box and the column of the matched
        # anchor box to all zeros. This ensures that those boxes will not be matched again,
        # because they will never be the best matches for any other boxes.
        weight_matrix[ground_truth_index] = 0
        weight_matrix[:,anchor_index] = 0
